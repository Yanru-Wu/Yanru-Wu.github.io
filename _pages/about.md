Hi, I'm **Yanru Wu (吴彦儒)**.

I am currently a junior at Huazhong University of Science and Technology. 

At present, I am fortunate to work with [Prof.Yue Wang](https://yuewang.xyz/) in the [PSI Lab](https://psi-lab.ai/lab.html) at University of Southern California. And my academic journey has also been enriched by a collaboration with [Prof.Yao Wan](http://wanyao.me/) in [ONE Lab](https://oneslab.github.io/) at Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

My research interests are broadly distributed in **Computer Vision**,**Embodied Intelligence** and **Reinforcement Learning**.
If you would like to discuss my research or potential collaborations further, feel free to contact me. I'm open to connect and collaborate with each other.
